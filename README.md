# telewater

A telegram bot that applies watermark on images, gifs and videos.

## Features

- **Fast** because it is made using async libraries.
- **Simple** to use.
- Any one who uses an instance of the bot will have to use the same watermark and position. This is meant to be used by **single person/organization** (by only you or your team), as configuration is stored at a global level instead of per user basis.
- **No database** connection required.
- It **does not store media** (photos/videos/gifs) on the server. Media is deleted immediately after the watermarked version is sent to the user.

Watch this [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ouyCPdZw0) to learn how to use and deploy this bot.

## Usage

Using the bot is very simple. Just send a photo, video or gif to the bot. The bot will reply with the watermarked media.

The bot commands `/set` and `/get` can set and get the value of the configuration variables. The commands are simple and intuitive. The bot will show you the usage if you send an incorrect argument.
